# `tabbar-mode` layer for spacemacs

Fork of https://github.com/evacchi/tabbar-layer. Changes include:
- Group separation between user buffers and emacs buffers.
- Alt-left for previous tab, Alt-right for next tab

Install with `git clone https://github.com/kdoomsday/tabbar-layer ~/.emacs.d/private/tabbar`

Then enable in your `~/.spacemacs` by adding `tabbar` to 
`dotspacemacs-configuration-layers`
